# Auto Robot Path Planning (A*)

A practical Python example demonstrating intelligent motion planning using the **A\*** pathfinding algorithm on a dynamic 2D grid.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project simulates a simplified 2-DoF robot navigating through a grid environment with dynamic obstacles and changing goal positions. The focus is on understanding heuristic search and demonstrating autonomous pathfinding behavior.

### Core Elements
- **2D Grid Environment** with random obstacles and target positions
- **A\*** Pathfinding Algorithm** for optimal route computation
- **Interactive Console Interface** with step-by-step and auto-run modes

---

## ✅ Features
- Autonomous navigation on a **2D grid**
- **No manual programming** required for test runs (simple HMI)
- **Modular and extendable** — suitable for expansion to multi-DOF or industrial robotic systems
- Demonstrates **real-world industrial relevance** via business case logic
