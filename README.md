# Auto-Robot-Path-Planning-A-
A practical Python example for intelligent motion planning using heuristic A*

## Project Overview

Within a university project, I built a Python prototype featuring:

- **2D grid** as a simulated environment with dynamic obstacles and random goals  
- **A\*** algorithm for optimal pathfinding  
- **Console visualization** & interactive auto-mode  

## Features

What this implementation enables:

✅ A simulated, simplified robot (2DoF) autonomously finding valid paths on a 2D grid
✅ No manual programming required upfront – simple HMI for test cases
✅ Modular design for scaling to multi-DOF or industrial robotic use cases
✅ Business case validation for industrial applications
